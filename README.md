The eight queens problem is the problem of placing eight queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that none of them attack one another (no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal). 
More generally, the 8 queens problem places 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard.

There are different solutions to this problem. The one I used here is the solution using backtracking.
The way in which we accomplished this is as follows:
-Firstly, we make the board and a space where we collect
-After we start from the topmost row
-We then make a recursive function takes the state of the board and the current row number as its parameter.
-After tha cis done we put a queen in a safe place and use the state of the board to advance to next recursive
call and add 1 to the current row. Afterward we revert the state of the board after making the call.
Safe function checks the current column, left top diagonal and right top diagonal.
-We keep calling the function till the row is out of bounds.
-If current row reaches the number of rows in the board then the board is filled.
-Store the state and return.

After I added simple functions to make the output look a little nicer.
I did that with the sleep_for() function.

I also added a function to print out 1 of 11 random quotes from famous people.
I used a variable in witch i stored a random number then i used % 10 to get a number between 0 - 10.
